# PythonClass
This repository was created because I joined a class that will teach me the basics of the programming language python.

Here you will see my progress under these 9 weeks.

You will get access to all my files and notes.

# Lesson 1-9
These are my notes for every lesson that I take which are 2-3 hours. These files also includes the work I have done during the lessons that our teacher gives us.

They are the files I go back to when I am studying and working on my homework. 

I'd say they are pretty organized and could therefore be useful for others who want to check what exactly we went through and learned. It has so far helped someone who was present during class but decided to not take notes and instead only listen.

# Homework 1-9 
In these files I will be working on the homework we get from our teacher that will be about the things we have gone through during that week's lesson.

# Other
The "Video1" file that I have up contains the notes I wrote while watching the video we got as homework during lesson 1.
